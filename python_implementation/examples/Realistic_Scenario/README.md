# Realistic Scenario Examples - Python

This directory contains Python implementations of realistic space environment scenarios for the 2020s era.

## Files

- **`realistic_scenario_2020s.py`** - Main realistic scenario script
- **`python_realistic_2020s_figure_*.png`** - Generated visualization plots

## Description

This scenario simulates a realistic 2020s space environment with:
- Enhanced launch activity reflecting modern space operations
- Mega-constellation deployments
- Increased debris generation
- 5-year high-resolution simulation

## Usage

```bash
cd Realistic_Scenario/
python realistic_scenario_2020s.py
```

## Outputs

The script generates comprehensive visualization plots showing:
1. Population summary over time
2. Orbital element distributions
3. 3D position visualization
4. Altitude vs eccentricity relationships
5. Summary statistics

Results are saved as PNG figures for analysis and reporting.

## Equivalent MATLAB Files

This Python script is equivalent to `realistic_scenario_2020s.m` in the MATLAB implementation.
